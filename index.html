                                <p class="mb-4 display-6">Part 1: My Current Strengths & Areas for Growth</p>
                                <p class="ptext">My current strengths at the beginning of the semester are my routine
                                    and time management. These are the skills that I brought with me to Northeastern
                                    University. I have a similar schedule for weekdays where I would wake up at 8 AM,
                                    get ready, eat breakfast, and go to class from 9 AM to 12 PM. After that, I will
                                    have lunch and I would have one more class from 1:35 PM until 2:40 PM. The library
                                    is usually where I go to study and work on assignments when I don’t have anything
                                    planned. I also love working out and I will go to the gym for around an hour right
                                    before I get dinner. At night, I sometimes will get more work done or play games to
                                    destress, and I will go to bed before midnight.</p>
                                <p class="ptext">I currently consider myself a “student” because I’m still learning more
                                    about myself, my network, career options, and even my surroundings. I am taking
                                    classes to increase my knowledge of different soft and technical skills. One of my
                                    values is experience because I am more effective at learning by doing it and
                                    experimenting with it, in addition to visualization learning. That experience of me
                                    interacting around will allow me to learn from it. On the other hand, I feel
                                    networking and meeting new people is also important to me to increase my experience.
                                    I am interested in learning more about other people’s culture and their backgrounds.
                                    By interacting with other people, we are learning from each other as well, therefore
                                    they are shaping the way I am. Thus, I value new experiences and networking.</p>
                                <p class="ptext">A change that I began to notice during the semester was that I tend to
                                    procrastinate less on homework and other activities. I used to have a very bad habit
                                    of getting distracted while doing work, therefore I would end up spending double the
                                    amount of time or even more on an assignment. Before coming to Northeastern, I had
                                    the mindset that college is going to be stressful, and that the workload is going to
                                    be stressful. Knowing that I procrastinate, I got into the habit of starting my
                                    assignment early, so even if I do procrastinate, I will still be able to finish on
                                    time and avoid stress at the last minute. Although the workload isn’t as bad as I
                                    thought, I believe that habit just pushes me to focus on the work and get it done
                                    before I do any fun activities.</p>
                                <p class="ptext">One area that I need improvement in is my public speaking skills. I’ve
                                    always been shy and don’t like to stick out in the crowd. I grew up with social
                                    anxiety and every time I tried speaking publicly, I would stutter and forget what to
                                    say. Because of that, my communication skills are not the best and it is one thing
                                    that I hope to improve throughout the semester. One step that I can take is to take
                                    a class on public speaking. I believe that will help with my social anxiety and
                                    learn how to speak confidently. In addition, I attend mock interview sessions
                                    because not only will that improve my communication skills, but it can also prepare
                                    me for technical and job interviews.</p>
                                <p class="ptext">Another area is my technical skills in computer science. I want to be
                                    ready for my first co-op session and be confident in my skills as a programmer. I
                                    also need to be ready for the interview since they will usually test on your
                                    technical knowledge such as data structures, algorithms, and different concepts. To
                                    prepare me for these, I would like to learn a new coding language to expose me to a
                                    different and new experience and create a project with the language to apply my
                                    knowledge into practice.</p>
                            </div>

                            <div id="part2">
                                <p class="mb-4 display-6">Part 2: My Long-Term Professional Goal</p>
                                <p class="ptext">Upon graduation, I want to get into the job market. I expect that I
                                    will be working as a software developer/engineer since I enjoy coding, hence it’s
                                    one of the reasons that I am currently pursuing a Computer Science degree. Some of
                                    the dream companies that I would love to work for is Intel, AMD, and Nvidia, or one
                                    of the big tech companies (Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, etc.). However, I
                                    will be satisfied in working for any company that has a good work balance life
                                    because I value more of the experience, I get out of the job rather than the
                                    prestige. </p>
                                <p class="ptext">As a software engineer, the responsibilities can vary a lot depending
                                    on the focus of the field. For example, a mobile software engineer may focus on
                                    developing mobile applications on iOS or Android platforms, or a full-stack software
                                    engineer will focus on the entire development process of a piece of software.
                                    Currently, I don’t know which field I will be interested in working in, however
                                    through the class that I will take at Northeastern and the Co-op opportunities, I
                                    will eventually discover the type of field that I will enjoy working in. </p>
                                <p class="ptext">My long-term professional goal is to become an entrepreneur and sell my
                                    idea. I want to be able to design a piece of software that will be able to improve
                                    the quality of life and everyday experience for people. This idea was inspired by
                                    how our lives were dramatically improved in terms of convenience and efficiency by
                                    all the apps around us. An example is Uber, which improved the convenience for
                                    getting around as well as provides a source of income. Since this is my long-term
                                    professional goal, I don’t expect to complete this soon, and getting a full-time job
                                    after graduation will be the first step.</p>
                            </div>

                            <div id="part3">
                                <p class="mb-4 display-6">Part 3: My Long-Term Personal Goals</p>
                                <p class="ptext">After my graduation, I hope that I have completed at least two co-op
                                    opportunities and at least one study abroad session. With these in mind, there are a
                                    couple of things I would like to accomplish within the first couple of years
                                    post-graduation.</p>
                                <p class="ptext">The first thing that I would like to accomplish is to travel abroad by
                                    myself. Growing up, I watched a lot of Travel Youtubers and read many travel blogs.
                                    I was fascinated by the different cultures and cool things that countries around the
                                    world have to offer. Therefore, after graduation, I want to experience what these
                                    Travel YouTubers experience and fulfill my childhood aspirations. The first location
                                    that I want to travel to by myself is China, specifically the lesser well-known
                                    cities. Whenever someone hears about traveling to China, they will always mention
                                    the popular big cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, as well as some of the popular
                                    attractions like the Great Wall of China and the Terracotta Army. However, when I
                                    have the opportunity to travel to China alone after graduation, I want to visit the
                                    lesser well-known city and experience more of China’s nature, in addition to the
                                    popular cities and attractions.</p>
                                <p class="ptext">Another thing that I want to accomplish is to dedicate half a year to
                                    self-improvement. Throughout the years, I have been constantly having to deal with
                                    balancing schoolwork and personal life. However, somehow, I put more time into
                                    schoolwork, and I don’t think I have invested enough time in my personal life. There
                                    are so many things that I would like to improve such as fitness, diets, and even
                                    skin care routines. So, I would like to just dedicate 6 months to improve physical,
                                    mental, and emotional health.</p>

                                    of daily life or the convenience of doing some tasks, or even some small quality of
                                    life improvement, I want to deliver that kind of improvement to people. To achieve
                                    this goal, there are many things’ competencies and skills that I will need to
                                    develop to achieve this goal.</p>
                                <p class="ptext">The first thing that I need to establish is an understanding of what is
                                    daily life for many of us. From there I can identify areas of improvement and create
                                    a solution in the form of software. For example, the founder of Uber identifies a
                                    problem where it was too expensive to hire a private driver and wanted to create a
                                    solution that will make direct transportation easier and less expensive So, the
                                    founder created Uber, where you can book a ride to get you to your destination as
                                    well as share the price between another person who has a similar destination.
                                    Therefore, if I want to improve our daily life, I need to find out areas of
                                    improvement in our day.</p>
                                <p class="ptext">Once I figure what I can improve, I need to think about how I can
                                    improve. This will surely require a lot of thinking and trial and error. After
                                    coming up with a solution, I will need some feedback and assess whether that
                                    solution will work in reality. I can get feedback from asking people who may benefit
                                    from this solution directly and indirectly. After that is sorted out, I can start
                                    working on developing the solution into a product. In this step, I will need enough
                                    coding knowledge and experience to make software out of the idea. So, in conclusion,
                                    I will need to find an issue, come up with a solution, asses the solution
                                    effectiveness, and then develop the solution.</p>
                                <p class="ptext">My personal goal is to travel abroad by myself, more specifically
                                    traveling to China and visiting local areas/attractions in addition to big cities
                                    and popular attractions. One competency and skill that I will need is the
                                    understanding of Chinese. Since I will be traveling alone, it is best to understand
                                    the local language. I currently do know Chinese, but I am not very good at reading
                                    and writing Chinese. I can work to improve my Chinese right now by taking some
                                    Chinese language classes at Northeastern as well join clubs such as The Chinese
                                    Language Table. Other skills that I will need are saving and budgeting. Travel
                                    international is really expensive and it is important to spend my money wisely to
                                    have enough money left to cover necessary spending. </p>
                                <p class="ptext">My other personal goal is self-improvement, and although I don’t need
                                    to develop competencies and skills for this goal, I still need to develop a good
                                    plan for me to accomplish the goal. Things like developing a fitness plan and coming
                                    up with ways that I can use to improve my physical, mental, and emotional health are
                                    necessary.</p>

                                <p class="ptext">Many of these plans are focused on improvement to both myself and the
                                    people around me. My professional goal is to develop a piece of software that will
                                    improve the daily life of myself and the people around me. My personal goals consist
                                    of traveling abroad to improve my global competencies and self-improvement of mental
                                    and physical health. All of these goals reflect on my personality and values. I
                                    believe that I am a very considerate person and have a willingness to help others
                                    out. Therefore, through my professional goals, I will be able to help others out and
